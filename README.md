Iâ€™m a recent Data Science graduate from UC San Diego with a passion for solving problems through data and code. I have experience working with Python, machine learning, and software development, and I enjoy creating data-driven projects with real world impacts. I am looking for entry-level opportunities in data science and software engineering.
